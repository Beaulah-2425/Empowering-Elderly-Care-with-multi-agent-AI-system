# Empowering Elderly Care with a Multi-Agent AI System

A cutting-edge AI-driven platform designed to revolutionize elderly care by integrating multiple intelligent agents to monitor, assist, and enhance the well-being and independence of senior citizens.
---
## 🧠 Overview

This project introduces a **Multi-Agent AI System** tailored for elderly care environments such as homes, assisted living facilities, and nursing centers. The system leverages cooperative AI agents that specialize in different domains—health monitoring, environment sensing, communication, and emergency response—to create a safer and smarter living space for the elderly.
---
## 🧩 Features

- **Health Monitoring Agent**  
  Tracks vital signs (heart rate, temperature, oxygen levels) via connected devices and alerts caregivers if anomalies are detected.

- **Environment Agent**  
  Monitors home conditions (lighting, temperature, movement) to ensure comfort and safety.

- **Companion Agent**  
  Offers conversational interaction and emotional support, reducing loneliness and promoting mental well-being.

- **Emergency Agent**  
  Detects falls or distress situations and triggers immediate alerts to medical personnel or family members.

- **Task Coordination**  
  Agents communicate and collaborate to prioritize tasks and make intelligent decisions based on context.
---
## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a modular multi-agent design using:

- Agent Communication Language (ACL)  
- Message Bus / Pub-Sub System  
- Knowledge Graph or Shared Context Database  
- ML Models for behavior prediction, anomaly detection, and personalized suggestions

[Sensor Devices] → [Individual Agents] → [Central Coordinator / Message Broker] → [Action or Notification]

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.10+

- MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto)

- Virtual environment (recommended)

- Device SDKs or Simulators for testing (e.g., wearable health monitors).
